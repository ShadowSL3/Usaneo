# 1.0.1 RC2 — Change of Gear

Six months. That’s how long it’s been since the last core refactor.  
This release isn’t just a revision — it’s a direction shift.

Some code aged well. Some didn’t. And some just had to go.

## Core Structure Updated

Let’s talk about structure.  
We wanted flexibility. A cleaner namespace. A setup that just *feels* right.

### Before (legacy):
```python
from usaneo.core import usaneo_init
```

## New(standard):
```python 
import usaneo.core as usc

ddf main():
  screen = usc.Screen()

```

# What We say GoodBye To

There’s always that moment in development where you realize:
“This no longer serves us.” And so, we cleaned house.
- sprites.py(removed)
- osio.py(removed)
- file_manager.py(removed)
- audio.py(removed)
- system.py(removed)
- fast_event.py(removed)
